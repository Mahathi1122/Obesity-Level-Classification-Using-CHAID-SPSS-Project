## ðŸ§  Domain Knowledge: Obesity & Health Analytics

Obesity is a major global public health concern, linked to numerous chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular issues. In this project, we used data-driven classification techniques to better understand and predict obesity risk levels.

Key domain knowledge incorporated:

- **Obesity Categories:** Used a 7-level classification system (from underweight to severe obesity) based on behavioral and physical attributes, aligning with WHO and clinical BMI standards.
- **Behavioral Health Indicators:** Variables like screen time, snacking, water intake, and physical activity are modern markers of obesity and reflect lifestyle transitions in developing countries.
- **Family History:** Recognized as a strong hereditary risk factor, especially for early-onset obesity.

This project bridges the gap between **statistical modeling** and **practical health decision-making**.

## ðŸ“Œ Insights from the Project

### âœ… CHAID Decision Tree Insights:
- **Obesity_Type_I, III, and Insufficient Weight** were highly predictable, showing distinct behavior patterns.
- **Normal and Overweight Levels I & II** had lower prediction accuracy due to overlapping lifestyle traits.
- **Frequent snacking, low physical activity, and high BMI** emerged as top predictors in branching.

### ðŸ“‰ Regression Analysis Insights:
- **Gender, BMI, Weight, Screen Time, and Family History** were statistically significant contributors to obesity (p < 0.05).
- **Screen Time** is a modern lifestyle factor, strongly associated with higher obesity risk.
- **BMI** validated as the strongest predictor â€” reaffirming its clinical relevance.
- **No multicollinearity** observed (VIF < 2) â€” ensuring reliability of regression interpretation.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Applications

- Can aid **public health interventions**, awareness programs, or personalized fitness apps.
- Visual CHAID tree is helpful for **non-technical stakeholders** like doctors or wellness coaches.
- Framework can be scaled to **predict other health conditions** (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) with similar behavioral data.
