# 🧠 Obesity Level Classification Using CHAID – SPSS Project

## 📁 Project Overview

This project applies the CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector) decision tree algorithm in IBM SPSS to classify individuals into one of seven obesity categories based on their lifestyle, behavioral, and physical characteristics. The findings are summarized visually in a PowerPoint presentation and supported by key output screenshots from SPSS.

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict an individual's obesity level using decision tree classification.
- Identify key variables like weight, BMI, screen time, and eating habits that influence obesity.
- Use a visually interpretative approach for stakeholders through SPSS output and PPT slides.

## 📈 Key SPSS Output

### 📌 Classification Table:
- Overall Accuracy: **64%**
- Best Predicted: Obesity Type I (90%), Obesity Type III (86.7%), Insufficient Weight (87.1%)
- Lower Accuracy: Normal Weight and Overweight Levels

### 📌 Decision Tree:
- CHAID tree shows multi-level splits based on factors like BMI, food frequency, physical activity, etc.
- Helpful in visualizing how lifestyle patterns lead to obesity categories.

### 📌 Regression Table:
- Significant Predictors (p < 0.05): Gender, Age, Weight, Height, BMI, Family History, Screen Time, Snacking
- VIF < 2: No multicollinearity detected

## 📚 Conclusion

The CHAID model in SPSS delivered interpretable and useful results in classifying obesity levels. The visual decision tree and output tables make it easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand the influencing factors. This project supports early health risk detection through behavioral pattern analysis.
